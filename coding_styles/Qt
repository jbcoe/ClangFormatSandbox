# Ideally we should also allow less short function in a single line, but
# clang-format does not handle that.
AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Inline

ReflowComments:  false

# The coding style specifies some include order categories, but also tells to
# separate categories with an empty line. It does not specify the order within
# the categories. Since the SortInclude feature of clang-format does not
# re-order includes separated by empty lines, the feature is not used.
